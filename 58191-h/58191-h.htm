<h2>Hints to Beginners in Bee
Culture.<br />

<small>BY H. M. DEWITT.</small></h2>

<p>This is the month that we should
begin to feed and build up our bees,
especially our weak colonies, and to
get them ready for the honey harvest.
Commence by giving them one
half pint thin sugar syrup each day;
do not feed them in the daytime, feed
them at night and they will have all
the feed taken down before the next
morning. This will start them to
rearing brood rapidly and by the
time the honey harvest arrives they
will be strong and overflowing with
bees ready for it. Make but a limited
number of swarms and make
them strong and early. Late natural
swarms should be returned to the parent
hive, about twenty-four hours
after hiving them. The colonies that
work freely on red clover should be
used as breeders in preference to
others as the tongues of these bees
are evidently longer.</p>

<p>The old queen always goes with the
first swarm unless she is unable to fly.
When making artificial swarms raise
your queens and drones from the best
colonies. A queenless colony will
raise queens at once if it has larvae
less than three days old and these
queens will hatch within 10 to 12
days. If you give your bees a good
supply of empty combs before the beginning
of the honey crop and keep
them at work they will rarely swarm.
But if they once find themselves
crowded and get the swarming fever,
nothing will keep them from swarming.
The honey harvest lasts but a
few weeks, so you must be ready for
it. “Make hay while the sun shines.”
When hiving a swarm give them a
hive full of worker comb, or comb
foundation if possible, or else give
them narrow stripes for guides, but
do not give them a hive partly filled
with comb, as they would be sure to
build a great deal of drone comb in
the remaining space.</p>

<h3>BEE DIARRHEA, FOUL BROOD, ETC.</h3>

<p>Bee diarrhea in the latter part of
winter and early spring is a malady
that effects some apiaries. The bees
discharge their excrements over the
hives and combs, producing a dark
appearance and offensive odor. The
cause is either fermented honey, improper
food, long confinement, or too
warm and poorly ventilated quarters.
Give them good capped honey and a
cleansing flight. If too cold for this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
out-of-doors take them into a warm
room, make a box, with the front and
top made of wire cloth, or mosquito
netting, adjust it to the entrance, so
that the bees must enter it on leaving
the hive. This will usually prove an
effectual remedy.</p>

<h3>FOUL BROOD.</h3>

<p>Foul brood is the rotting of brood in
a hive; the caps of the sealed brood
appear indented and shriveled and
the larvae and young bees in unsealed
cells become putrid, emitting a disgusting
stench or smell. When the
disease has a firm hold, even though
it may be possible to cure it, I would
advise the total destruction by fire of
the bees, combs, frames and hives,
with everything which might harbor
the disease. In its primary stages it
can be cured in this way: With an
atomizer spray the hives, bees, brood,
honey and combs with a solution of
salicylic acid, borax and rain water,
repeated on the sixth day. Remove
the diseased brood from the hive and
give them capped honey, if not too
far advanced this may give relief.</p>

<p>There is another plan, which is as
follows: Take a clean new hive with
new, clean frames, fill it with
comb foundation, take and run
all the bees out of the diseased hive
into the clean one, do this in the evening
and as soon as the bees are all in
close the entrance with wire cloth,
keep them confined for forty-eight
hours until they have consumed all
the honey in their sacks in building
comb. At the end of forty-eight
hours open the entrance and let them
fly if they wish, feed them a little
sugar syrup every night for about a
week, and if the honey season is over,
or, if this is done during a dearth of
honey you should feed them regularly
so as not to let them starve. I had
the disease in my apiary the past season
and this is the plan I used to cure
it. My bees are as healthy now as
as if they had never had it.</p>

<p>[The instructions which friend Dewitt
gives in the first part of the foregoing
article will apply this month
only to the more southern localities.
Here in the North the hives in many
places are still covered with snow and
the bees should not be disturbed until
spring has unmistakably arrived.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="New_Inventions">

New Inventions.<br />

<small>BY JOHN F. GATES.</small></h2>

<p>The question has been asked “Are
we drifting from our moorings.”
I used to think that we should not,
but if all bee-keepers anchored to one
idea there would be no improvements.
While it is safe to our own pockets to
be conservative, yet no class has done
more to advance the interests of the
bee-keepers than those who experiment,
and seem not to be satisfied
with their present condition. Had
the inventors of the Monitor been
contented with wooden war ships our
great American Republic would have
been divided. Had we all been content
with stage coaches where would
our railroads have been? Had Edison
preferred to sit at his telegraph instrument
we should now be without
his master ideas. This onward impelling
force in Americans has sought
out so many good things in the last
fifty years that I have not space to
tell them. Some rejoice in real improvements.
Well, we can’t grind out
out a grist of real improvements to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
order. We have many discouragements
and losses before we succeed in
turning out one. Many of these inventions
must be tested by bee-keepers
before a true verdict can be given,
and we should all be willing to lend a
hand to be one of the great jury in
the discussion of these cases as they
are brought before us by our leaders;
the inventors. Yet while the tester
goes hand and hand with the inventor,
each watching the others movements,
each helping the other to discover
and rectify mistakes. It is too
true that many good inventions have
been swamped and for years laid dormant
when they might have been in
use, simply for the lack of wisdom to
guide us to small experiments first.
Yes, there seems to be too much rush,
new things can’t be tested in a hurry.
To change an average apiary all at
once to some new mode of management,
or new style of hive, even if the
hives were given to us, would be unwise.
But add the cost of hives and
fixtures which the change involves
with the loss which one is sure to meet
with for a time under any new arrangement,
and can we wonder that
there is so little confidence placed in
inventions or the inventors. Still
had we gone more slowly, tested more
carefully, and on a smaller scale and
given ourselves more time to sum up
the evidence, no doubt many times our
verdict would bless instead of curse
the inventor. No doubt there are inventors
who abuse one’s confidence,
but they too well have but little
chance to deceive us if we go slow.
We can change too much, and again
too little. I am aware that I have
missed some good opportunities by
being a little too set in my ways, and
I have had too little charity for improvements;
medium ground is safe
ground on which to stand. We
should watch the signs of the times
and not jump conclusions, nor bite at
all that takes our fancy, nor kick at
all that we despise, we ought always
to review, draw conclusions and watch
very closely what the mass of bee-keepers
seem to favor, or decide upon.
If we are good readers of indications
we need never get left, and often can
go across lots, thus reaching the head
of the procession, but be sure we know
the way across else better we had
gone around.</p>

What I Have Observed, Etc.<br />

<small>BY T. K. MASSIE.</small></h2>

<p class="copy">(<i>Concluded.</i>)</p>

<p>In the last article I promised to
give some evidence confirming my
conclusions, but before doing so I
want to say a word in regard to “large
vs. small hives.” In the discussion
of the subject in the different bee
journals from time to time, I neglected
to note the size of the frame
used by the advocates of a large hive,
but I imagine they use a deeper
frame than the “L,” and if so they
are evidently right in advocating a
large hive, for such a hive would be
better proportioned, and would conform
nearer to the natural requirements
of the bees than a small hive
with shallow frames.</p>

<p>In <i>Gleanings</i> for July 15th, page
553, friend C. J. H. Gravenhurst, in
speaking of “handling hives instead
of frames,” hits on the same ideas given
in these articles in regard to the winter
problem. He tells us that the bees
winter better in the straw skeps than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
they do in the movable frame hives,
as made and used at present. This is
because the bees in the skeps have
their hives propolished overhead
which prevents upward ventilation
and keeps the bees dry. He also says
he gets more honey with less labor
and cost; then he shows how he
sought to combine the skeps with
the movable frame hive, advocating
about the same advantages that I
have given in these articles.</p>

<p>But the most clinching arguments
in favor of doing away with the useless
Hill device &amp;c., is found in Ernest R.
Root’s review of G. R. Pierce’s book,
“The Winter Problem in Bee-Keeping,”
which appeared in <i>Gleanings</i>
for December 16, ’91, page 952. Mr.
Pierce says the pollen theory is not
the cause of diarrhea; that diarrhea
in bees is caused by cold and lack of
stores, and is only intestinal catarrh.</p>

<p>Chaff cushions, or other porous material
over a sealed cover are all right
and serve a good purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Pierce is a thorough advocate of
protection and packing around the
bees; but the cover must be sealed down
that no heat can escape into the packing
above. In the first of this series
of articles I took this same position.
I said “Therefore I have drawn the
conclusion that a thin walled hive,
protected by a movable winter case,
and packed on all sides with a cushion
made of felt and filled with some
non-conducting material&mdash;one that
will prevent all radiation of heat will
be best”&mdash;and, in substance, that we
could remove cases and packing on
warm days and have our hives purified
by the sun and air and protect our
bees by wrapping them up with the
warm cushions and prevent the radiation
of heat at night. In the second
article (See <span class="smcap">American Bee-Keeper</span>,
page 164) I said the “pollen” theory,
and upward ventilation, cut no figure
in the winter problem in my locality.
Now if we place a thin board down
solid on the top bars of our brood
frames early enough in the fall for
the bees to glue up the crevices and
thus prevent all air currents from
passing up through our hives, we
again get even with our box hive
brethren, and when we prevent all
radiation of heat by placing a cushion
on top of this board, the same as
we do the sides. And further, in
spring and early summer, when we
give our bees just the ventilation required
by raising this board, we are
another long step ahead of them.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1891 I had The W.
T. Falconer Manf’g.’ Co. make for
me closed end frames with winter
passages through the top bars, and
boards to be sealed down for the purpose
of carrying out my plan as given
above.</p>

<p>“Ernest” tells us of his experiments
in using thin boards and pieces of
glass imbedded with white lead paste,
as it was too cold for the bees to seal
them down with propolis. Under the
glass he placed a thermometer, which,
when the weather outside in the wind
was ten degrees above zero, registered
45 to 50, and “<i>the hive was perfectly dry
inside</i>.” These are valuable experiments
in the right line.</p>

<p>My ideas, as it is plain to be seen,
were given to the public before friend
Pierce’s book made its appearance,
and before “Ernest” tried any experiments
on this plan.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>On page 592 of <i>Gleanings</i>, L. Stachelhausen
tells us that having found
out the advantages of closed end
frames, he will use no other. The
closed end frames have only to be
given a fair trial to prove their superiority
over all hanging frames. All
the “rattle traps and nuisances” I have
mentioned in these articles will soon
give way to something better and
more simple.</p>

<p>Friend Lowry Johnson also is of
my way of thinking, as his article in
the <span class="smcap">American Bee-Keeper</span> for December,
’91, page 182, will show.
Also Brother Quigley of the <i>Missouri
Bee-Keeper</i>, is advising his readers
that a board sealed down on top of
frames is better for wintering than
cushions next to the bees. See his
answer to a correspondent to his paper,
page 144.</p>

<p>These articles end here, but I would
like the opinion of the reader on the
points taken in them.</p>

<h2 id="A_Talk_on_Bee_Hives_Fixed">
<img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /><br />
A Talk on Bee Hives&mdash;Fixed
Races&mdash;Honey Crops, Etc.<br />

<small>BY S. L. WATKINS.</small></h2>

<p>The production of honey is the
principal object that a beginner has
in view when he contemplates starting
in the apiarian business. Of
course, he generally buys a few box
hives and does the transferring himself;
which I think is a good idea, as
he gains considerable knowledge of
the inside of a bee-hive and of handling
bees. Before he invests in bees,
he generally buys and reads a couple
of bee books and obtains a few catalogues
of leading apiarian manufactures,
to see what style of hive is best.
If he is gifted with an average insight
into the mystery of common
things, he will quickly choose the
hive and system that are most universally
used, and will stick to that system,
and nine chances in ten he will
make a success of his bee business.
If, however, he is gifted with a volatile
nature, he will not be satisfied
until he has eight or ten different
style hives in his apiary at one time,
and will spend all the money he
makes in trying new apiarian fixtures,
until he finally gives the bee
business up in disgust. I do not
mean to say that all new bee hives
are useless&mdash;far from it; but generally
speaking, there is a flood of new
style bee hives on the market which
are miraculously complicated and contain
numerous paraphernalia in the
way of wedges, glass doors, clasps,
useless bee spaces and other ornaments
not worthy of mention.</p>

<p>A hive that is too complicated will
never come into general use. Competition
in the honey business requires
that we use the cheapest appliances,
combined with the greatest excellences.
Here in this state (California)
where honey is so cheap, it would
be folly to spend $8.00 for a bee-hive,
because a $1.50 hive will answer
every purpose equally as well, the
hive does not make any difference in
the amount of honey gathered, bees
will store as much honey in a box
hive as in any frame hive ever devised;
the queen and race of bees
make the difference in the amount of
surplus gathered. The simplicity
hive, with its various modifications,
is the hive that gives the best satisfaction
among advanced apiarists, and
when used with the Hoffman frames
it is hard to beat. To persons who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
contemplate starting out-apiaries, the
Hoffman frame offers very superior
advantages. My opinion is, that bee-keepers
who keep out-apiaries, and
who move bees considerably, will in
time settle down to the fixed frame.
I shall no doubt experiment considerably
with fixed frames the next few
seasons.</p>

<p>In Ventura county this state, the
bee-keepers have adopted the Langstroth
as the standard frame, and
there is something like 1,600 hives in
that county, which produce annually
about $60,000 worth of honey. The
one pound section is rapidly gaining
favor with the progressive apiarists of
this state, and are fast superseding
the old Harbinson two pound section.</p>

<p>Our honey crop here last season
was about one fourth of a crop. In
the upper Sierras, at an elevation of
3,000 feet and upwards, there was a
good crop. Some honey plants yielded
well. In all extensively irrigated
districts bees did pretty well because
of the abundance of alfalfa grown.
Reports from Antelope Valley state
that in that section the honey crop
was far better than usual, 200 to 400
lbs. to the colony for entire apiaries
being the yield.</p>

<p>The Italian race of honey bees I
have tried pretty extensively, and
found them to be very good, but I
like the Carinolans better. I think
they are a fixed race; the Italians are
not.</p>

<p>In an apiary composed of Italian
and hybrids if a Carinolan queen be
introduced and the Carinolans then
be left to reproduce themselves naturally
they will hold their own for
hundreds of generations before their
markings will begin to be eliminated.
Place a colony of Carinolans in an isolated
location, and allow natural
breeding, and in ten years they will
not deteriorate a single bit; but take a
colony of Italians, and allow natural
breeding and in a year or two we
have nothing but common black, or
very poor hybrid bees; thus proving
conclusively that the Italians are not
a fixed race.</p>

<h2 id="A_Few_Words_to_Beginners">
<img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /><br />
A Few Words to Beginners.<br />

<small>BY T. K. MASSIE.</small></h2>

<p>As <span class="smcap">The American Bee-Keeper</span>
is published in the interest of beginners,
allow me to say to them that
the first thing to be learned is the fact
that no set rules can be given to suit
everyone under all the varying conditions
of climate, location, etc., and
that everyone must use intelligence
and make rules to suit his own individual
case&mdash;must make a vigorous
use of his own “think shop.” He
must thoroughly acquaint himself
with the flora of his location; he must
know when the honey flow is likely
to commence and end, and must manipulate
his bees to suit that time.
Friend Doolittle’s advice to manipulate
our bees at the proper time cannot
be too strongly impressed upon
the minds of beginners. In my locality
we have two honey flows each
year. The early flow last season ended
on the 24th day of July, the fall
flow commenced on the 16th of September.
There was a dearth from
July 24th to September 16, of 53
days. A hive full of bees during
these 53 days are not only of no use
to me but a positive disadvantage.
They are only consumers and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
honey gatherers because there is no
honey to be gathered. Reason would
dictate to me that I must use every
means in my power to build up my
colonies as strong as possible from
early in the spring to within 35 days
of the end of the honey flow, or about
the 19th of June, that about this
time, certainly not later than June
25th, I must restrict my queen to as
few frames as possible, so as to have
but few bees during the 53 days of
dearth. (I base my calculation upon
the fact that 21 days are required for
the egg to hatch and then the bee
must be 14 days old before it becomes
a forager.) Now I wish to say emphatically
that every one whose location
is similar to mine must practice
restriction or his honey crop will be a
failure every time. Again by the
16th of September. I want my hives
as full of bees as possible ready for
the fall flow. Then going back 35
days from September 16th takes me
to August 12th, the day on which the
eggs must be laid for the bees to have
hatched out, ready for the beginning
of the fall flow. But as the queens
could not under any circumstances
fill the hives full of eggs on the 12th
day of August, (or any other one day
for that matter,) reason would again
tell me that I must remove the restrictions
from my queens two or three
weeks before, or, say July 24th to
August 1st, and then stimulate brood
rearing. If the beginner fails to follow
this plan he will certainly get no
surplus fall crop. We must also make
sure that each colony contains a good
prolific queen.</p>

<p>Brother Demaree’s “Practical hints
in Bee Culture” on page 179, <span class="smcap">American
Bee-Keeper</span>, is timely and
should be read and studied until perfectly
familiar with every “hint” he
has given. When he speaks of the
bees “crowding the queen” being
simply an effort on the part of nature
to assist the bees by curtailing brood
rearing during the honey flow he is certainly
correct, yet, by restricting our
queens as I have suggested above we
accomplish the same end, provided the
restriction is performed at the right
time. When he speaks of giving his
colonies, after swarming, a queen cell
instead of a laying queen, as some “innocent
bee men” had written him, he
gives a “hint” that should be well
and long remembered. By this plan
he also assists the bees in curtailing
brood rearing, when such brood would
hatch out bees that would be consumers
instead of honey gatherers.</p>

<p>His article on “Concentration of
Forces” in <i>Bee-Keepers Guide</i> for December,
1891, page 356, is worth the
price of that paper for several years.
“Concentration of forces” is his remedy
against poor honey seasons. His
plan of “concentrating forces” can be
easily carried out in connection with
the suggestions I have given. He
says “not a swarm should be allowed
to issue.” He accomplishes this by
one single manipulation, which is
simple and easy, and performed “just
at the commencement of the honey
season, and before any swarms issue.”
All the colonies strong enough to cast
swarms are treated on the following:</p>

<h3>PLAN.</h3>

<p>“All the combs containing brood
are removed from the brood chamber,
except one that contains but a small
amount of unsealed brood and eggs.
This is left in the brood chamber with
the queen on it. If she is not found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
on it she must be hunted up and put
upon this comb. The brood chamber
is now filled out with empty combs
and a queen excluder is placed on its
top. The combs containing brood are
adjusted in a super or hive body, and
if they do not fill it, it is filled out
with empty combs. It now goes on
top of the brood chamber with the
queen excluder between. We now
have all the brood above the excluder,
except what is in the comb with the
queen on it below the excluder.
You now have nothing to do but to
“turn up” to suit the season. Treating
all colonies in this way the season will
have to be more than usually extended
if there is a single swarm. Colonies
treated in this way are the strongest
colonies I ever handled, and I
never seen a season so barren of nectar
that they fail to fill the combs
above the excluder by the time all the
brood they contain are hatched out,
and if the season is a good one they
will surprise the natives and make
you uneasy about the safety of your
honey floor, like mine did me the past
season, though the season was but an
average one.”</p>

<p>Next month I will give my experiments
with two colonies the past season
managed on a plan similar to
to Brother Demaree’s, as given above.
Remember, beginner, that if you don’t
manage your bees intelligently you
had better never go into the business
for you will have no “luck” and the
business will be a failure with you;
and you might as well try to raise
corn without seed as to try to raise
honey without a scientific work on
bee culture and one or more of the
many excellent bee journals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ed. Am. Bee-Keeper</span>, Dear Sir:
I inclose herewith 50 cents for renewal
to the <span class="smcap">Bee-Keeper</span>, and in a
month or so you will receive a little
order for supplies from me, but I wish
to find out first what I need. There
is a lot of reading in the <span class="smcap">American
Bee-Keeper</span> for beginners, but there
are so many different ideas given that
the beginner must have a big head
indeed to remember them. I will
take the liberty to tell you how I began.
It was a year ago about Christ Christmas
when I resolved to keep bees. I
wrote to the <i>New York Volkszeitung</i>,
a German newspaper, for the address
of a good bee paper, and I received
your address. The same day I sent
50 cents and received in time the
<i>American Bee-Keeper</i>, in which I
found the address of Mr. Knickerbocker
of Pine Plains, N. Y., to whom
I wrote for a catalogue and price list
for bees and queens. The price of a
good colony of Italians was $8.00,
and I sent him $16.00 and got two
colonies of bees about the 20th of
May, which was after all fruit trees
had blossomed. The bees commenced
to work, and the 15th of July
I took out of each hive the surplus
case of 28 sections well filled with
white honey. I replaced them with
new surplus cases, and about the 12th
of October both the hives were as full
of honey as they could be again. I
left the hives in this condition for
winter so the bees can consume as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
much as they please, and if there
should be any honey left this spring
it is just as good for me as if I took it
out in the fall. I left them on the
summer stands packed up good and
warm and will leave them alone until
spring. I do not think much of looking
into the hives every little while.
I may be wrong, but I think this
would make the bees swarm earlier
next season.</p>

<p>I cannot find any one around here
who knows anything about bee-keeping.
I sold 40 sections of honey and
16 I kept for myself. There is at
least 35 pounds in the hive yet, and
I think I did very well for the first
year. With regards I remain,</p>

As my subscription has expired, I send
you herewith a postal note for 50
cents, as I cannot do without the <span class="smcap">Bee-Keeper</span>.
I think it is the best bee
paper for new beginners or old ones.
I put seven colonies in my cellar and
left the balance on the summer stands,
so far they have all done well; some
that were a little short I fed up. Last
season was a poor season for bees
here, so those that came off late did
not gather enough to get through the
winter.</p>

<p>My way of feeding bees is to get an
empty comb and put it on a thin
board, then put it on the top of the
hive and put sugar syrup in it. The
bees will fill themselves and carry it
and put it in the empty comb below.

<p>The winter of ’90 and ’91 was a

lost all but three swarms. Did not
get a drop of surplus honey; something
that has not happened before in
the forty years we have had bees. Up
to date what few I have appear to be
getting through the winter all right.
The weather has been quite mild with
but little snow.</p>

<p>I will tell you how I pack my bees
for wintering. I had 12 strong colonies
in ten frame simplicity hives
about Nov. 20th, I did not molest
them in the brood chamber at all. I
just took off the top of the hive and
set on top of the frames a super without
any sections in it and filled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
it with buckwheat chaff and
packed it tight. To be sure the
enameled cloth was on top of the
frames under the chaff. There was
enough ventilation between the super
and the side of the top of hive or upper
story, as I do not think the caps
on the hives were any too light to prevent
the foul air from escaping. I
will tell you in the spring what success
I will have had in wintering.</p>

<h3>WINTERING ON SUMMER STANDS.</h3>

<p>The question of wintering is always
of interest and for that reason is always
seasonable. In treating the
question I do not expect to give any
new points to experts, but many of
the readers of this magazine are beginners,
and are looking to this valuable
journal for information on this
as well as on all other apicultural matters.
Many successful apiarists of
large experience claim that all wintering
should be done in cellars, or other
special depositories; with these I
have no quarrel, but never having
wintered except on summer stands, I
am unable to speak thereof from personal
experience. One objection to
this plan of wintering I can well imagine
will force itself into the minds
of a large majority, viz.: the expense
required to fit up as it should be fitted,
with regard to ventilation and temperature,
such a special depository as is
necessary in order to guarantee success
and the objection of itself will probably
prevent that majority from incurring
the required expense.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the same majority
I will give in detail the plan of
wintering on summer stands, adopted
by myself with perfect success, and
which I have made use of for eighteen
years or more, and that too on
Langstroth frames, with single walled
seventh-eight inch pine hives.</p>

<p>As theories in regard to matters
connected with apiculture are of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
little consequence when compared
with actual facts. I will not attempt
to theorize now, but will detail the
facts for the use of any who may desire
to know them.</p>

<p>When the honey season ends, which
with myself is about the 10th of September,
I examine the condition of
every colony, crowd each colony on to
seven frames I intend they shall all
be strong enough to cover fully that
number and see that each frame is at
least filled with sealed stores in its upper
half the whole length. Later on
when I get ready to back for winter I
extract if necessary from those combs
that are more than two-thirds filled
with stores and combs throughout the
brood chamber are equalized and placed
in a position where the colony can at
times get at them if desired. When
the temperature falls so low that the
colony begins to cluster closely I
force the cluster to one side or other
of the brood chamber, which can easily
be done, by moving the frames
on which the cluster is formed. Prior
to this, however, I have stimulated
the queen by feeding regularly each
day a small amount of sugar syrup,
and thus kept the colony rearing
brood as long as possible.</p>

<p>After the cluster is forced to the
side of the hive I place a “Hill’s Device,”
or some substitute therefor, over
the frames, and cover the bees with a
light porous blanket. Burlap or cotton
duck is as good as anything for
this purpose. The “Hill’s Device”
under the blanket forms a means of
communication for the bees with
every frame in the hive, and that too
without danger of becoming chilled.
As the hive in use is wide enough for
ten frames I use one and a half inch
division board in each side of the
hive, which allows the seven frames to
be spread apart a little more than desirable
for summer use. After covering
the frames in closely so that not a
bee can show his head outside, I put
on an upper story and fill it one-third
full of forest leaves pressed lightly
down, and use a cover with one and a
half inch hole bored in each end for
ventilation.</p>

<p>I give a large entrance, using a
bridge about four inches wide for the
bees to crawl under, which prevents
the easy access of sudden draughts
into the hive. The only other protection
than that prescribed above,
found in my apiary is a close osage
hedge, six feet high on the north and
west sides. With the above means
of protection my bees have withstood
the rigors of our eastern winters for
years, with a temperature varying
from 20 degrees above to 20 degrees
below zero, and some seasons
without a purifying flight from middle
of November to middle of the following
February. Many mornings
with the thermometer below zero in
January I have found a warm current
of air being forced out from the entrance,
so strong as to be perceptibly
felt upon the back of the hand. I
know not and care not whether others
may agree with me or not, I state the
facts as I find them, and have no hesitation
whatever in advising every beginner
to follow the methods outlined
above.&mdash;<i>J. E. P. in B. K. M.</i>, (<i>Mass.</i>)</p>

<h3>SURPLUS HONEY.</h3>

<p>Under the modern system of bee
culture we obtain two kinds of honey,
known as comb and extracted. Comb
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
honey is brought before the consumer
just as it was stored by the bees, while
extracted honey is the pure honey
emptied from the comb by means of
the honey extractor. If not adulterated
by middlemen both are equally
healthful and nutritious.</p>

<p>Honey is not a luxury, but a necessary
addition to our food, it being
the pure sweet as secreted by the flowers
from which it is gathered by the
bees, being healthful and much safer
than the poisonous confections sold
under the name of “candy.”</p>

<p>Comb honey is preferred by many
on account of its fine appearance. It
must be placed in the market in good
shape, indicating that it is intended
for food and not simply as a luxury, a
sweet morsel to be tasted by the children.
Some of our writers on bee culture
(but I am happy to say only
a few) went wild some time ago
advocating one-half pound frames.
They argue that it can be sold at a
higher price, but all bee-keepers
know that forcing bees into such
small combs greatly reduces the crop,
and if such a course could be pursued
by our bee men it would at once convey
the idea that honey was only a
substitute for candy or chewing gum.
My advice to the bee-loving readers
of this magazine is to let them severely
alone in their craze. A season or
two will abolish such small things.
The man whose soul is so small and his
ideas so contracted, and his business
principles so mean as to place a half
pound honey package upon the market
for the purpose of extorting a half
penny or so from his fellow man deserves
to be classed with&mdash;you may
draw your own comparison.</p>

<p>Anything smaller than a one pound
section or frame is a loss to the producer
as well as the consumer. A one
pound comb makes a nice package,
and such frames can be nicely crated
and safely shipped.</p>

<p>Comb honey should be removed
from the hive as soon as all the cells
are sealed over. If left to remain it
becomes darker by the bees passing
over it. When taken from the hive
it should be placed in a dark room
until sold or shipped to market.
Some writers advise smoking it with
sulphur to kill the wax worm. I
never found this necessary, as I never
have found worms on my comb honey.
Honey should be nicely graded, and
the finest shipped or sold in separate
lots. My frames hold two pound each,
of these I place six in a crate having
glass at each end showing quality of
honey. These crates suit the retail as
well as the wholesale dealers and consumers
generally buy a whole crate&mdash;12
to 13 pounds. Many of my customers
in adjoining towns buy from
three to six crates. Unfinished or
partly sealed combs can be emptied
with the extractor and put away for
next season.</p>

<p>Extracted honey should be placed
in nice, clean, attractive packages.
For home trade self-sealing jars do
very well. For shipping, kegs are
found to be the best.</p>

<p>Just here I would give a word of
warning. Do not extract before your
honey is sealed, if you do it is not
ripe and too thin and will sour, thus
spoiling your reputation as a honey
producer. Don’t be too eager to obtain
a large quantity, let the quality
be good and you will have no trouble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
to find plenty of buyers. It is only
the poor, unripe article that cannot be
sold, and which gives some of our
writers in the bee papers so much
trouble to find a way to dispose of
their honey.</p>

<h3>EXPOSE YOUR HIVES TO THE SUN.</h3>

<p>In a village in Germany, where the
number of bees kept was regulated by
law, a bad season had proved that the
place was overstocked, from the great
weakness of all the colonies in the
neighborhood. There was but one
exception, that of an old man who
was generally set down as being no
wiser than his neighbors. The honey
harvest came round, and when he had
stored away double the quantity that
any of the rest had saved, he called
his friends and neighbors together,
took them into his garden, and said:
“If you had been more charitable in
your opinions, I would have told you
my secret before,” and he pointed to
the facing of his hives&mdash;one degree
more to the east than was generally
adopted. The sun came upon his
hives an hour or two sooner by the
movement, and his bees were up and
stirring, and had secured a large share
of the morning’s honey before his
neighbors’ bees had roused themselves
for the day.</p>

<h3>SNOW AND OUTDOOR WINTERING.</h3>

<p>The heavy fall of snow which we
have just had is very favorable for
outdoor wintering, and we would advise
our readers not to shovel it away
from the hives, but if you have time
put a little more on with a snow
shovel. We would much rather have
ten feet of snow over hives than none
at all.</p>

<p>A friend of ours once told us how
he had made a great mistake by digging
away the snow from some of his
hives, but at the same time learned a
valuable lesson. His apiary was situated
in somewhat of a valley, and
one morning after a heavy fall of
snow which had been considerably
drifted, he looked out and was dismayed
to see his entire apiary buried
beneath the fleecy flakes. One portion,
however, was much worse than
the other&mdash;that at the north end
being buried in some places ten feet
deep. The south end was not so bad,
and so he determined to clear what he
could and leave the rest to perish, as
he supposed. After considerable
shoveling he got about 25 colonies
pretty well cleared off, and by dint of
hard work managed to keep them clear
till spring. When warm weather
came these 25 colonies were flying in
and out, while the snow was still lying
upon the other portion. Thinking
the latter were dead he paid no attention
to them till quite late in the
spring, when the tops of some of them
began to show above the snow, and
what was his surprise and delight to
discover every colony in splendid condition,
some of them filled with brood,
and all ready for a good season’s
work, while at the same time they had
not consumed nearly so much stores
as those he kept clear of snow! Upon
investigation he discovered that the
heat from the bees had melted spaces
about the hives varying in size from
a square foot to a square yard, and
the air from the hives became purified
by contact with the snow, while
at the same time the temperature was
kept so even and was so little affected
by the cold breezes of winter that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
very little stores were consumed.</p>

<p>The method of purifying air is one
which is taken advantage of by some
of our native animals. We have
often amused ourselves by watching
the otter who will stay underneath
the ice for hours together engaged in
fishing, and when finding it necessary
to breathe will place his nose against
the ice, expel the air from his lungs
when it forms a bubble between ice
and water, and then inhale it again.&mdash;<i>C.

<h3>STRAWBERRIES IN OCTOBER.</h3>

<p class="copy">(From Western Garden, Oct. ’91.</p>

<p>To-day’s mail brings a fine specimen
plant of the New Wonder Strawberry
from J. B. Alexander, of Hartford
City, Ind. It is a strong plant,
and the peculiarity about it is that it
has three ripe and fourteen green berries
on it, besides quite a number of
blossoms. Our readers should try a
few plants of this wonder. See Golden
Rule Nursery “ad.” elsewhere.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some women cannot keep bees, any
more than some men; but many can,
and to their great profit. Often a
farmer’s wife or daughter welcomes
an occupation for the sake of its novelty,
something to break up the routine
of cooking, washing and sewing;
and bee-keeping, even if it brings
only a few pounds of honey for the
table, is undertaken and carried
through with pleasure and delight.&mdash;<i>Ex.</i></p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let it be remembered, says Julia
Allyn, that the more bees there are
on farms the greater will be the product
of the farms; for the bees distribute
pollen and fertilize flowers more
thoroughly than they can be fertilized
otherwise.</p>

<h3>EDITORIAL.</h3>

<p>Some of our readers being beginners,
are often perplexed to know just
what methods of the many different
ones advocated by our contributors
will be the best for their individual
needs. Now, there are many methods
of manipulating bees and hives, any
one of which followed out will bring
success. Take “Wintering” for instance.
Some of the most successful
bee-keepers winter out-doors. Others
in-doors. Some with chaff hives;
hives with air spaces or with outside
winter cases. Some winter in cellars,
and others in special depositories or
in bee houses. Each method has its
strong supporters.</p>

<p>About the only thing to be considered
in adopting either method is the
climatic location. For instance, bees
in the Southern states will not winter
well in cellars, nor are chaff hives
necessary, while in the Northern
states, outside cases packed, dead air
spaces, chaff hives or in-door wintering
is a necessity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>A great many letters of complaint
have been received from persons to
whom we have been sending the <span class="smcap">Bee-Keeper</span>,
because we asked them to
pay for it. Many of them say they
never subscribed and do not think
they should be compelled to pay. We
do not send this magazine to anyone
unless ordered to do so, excepting to
the former subscribers of the <i>Advance
Bee-Hive</i> and <i>Bee World</i>, whose subscription
lists we have purchased, and
we have continued after their original
subscriptions have expired, excepting
when ordered to stop doing
so by the subscribers themselves.
We have frequently mentioned the
necessity of ordering us to stop if
the magazine was not wanted, and
have sent postal card notices to
to those whose subscriptions have
expired six months back or more.
Now, we do not wish any one to
take this magazine against their
wishes, nor pay for it either, but
we do wish you would notify us on
a postal card or otherwise, if you
want it stopped when your subscription
expires.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Paddock Pure Food Bill now
before the United States Senate is
one in which every bee-keeper
should be interested. The bill provides
for the prevention, by government
inspection, of the mis-branding
or mis-labelling of all articles of
food and drugs. In other words, if
a can containing honey is marked
“Pure Honey,” it will necessarily be
exactly what the name implies, and
not an adulteration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have been making an extensive
inquiry as to the styles of
hives in most general use throughout
the country, especially in the
Eastern and Middle states, and we
wish our friends would send in
their views in regard to the advantages
of the Simplicity or Langstroth
style of hives over the old style
box hives. Send it to us either as
a regular contribution or correspondence
for publication.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We notice in <i>Gleanings</i>, <i>The Review</i>,
<i>Progressive Bee-Keeper</i> and other
journals the “ad.” of the “Chicago
Bee-Keeper’s Supply Company,” in
which they state their office as being
68-70 South Canal Street., Chicago.
Parties interested have endeavored
to find such a concern at this street
number but they have failed to do
so. A man by the name of Kline,
claiming to be the secretary of the
company, offered this magazine a
very liberal “ad.” some months ago,
but as our information regarding
the concern was not satisfactory we
declined to accept the “ad.” All
bee-keepers will do well to deal
only with old established manufacturers
and dealers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hereafter we will put the name
of the state in which they are written
at the end of all articles, so that
our readers will know that a method
or system advanced by a bee-keeper
in Georgia, for instance,
will not be of much use to any one
in this state, especially if it relates
to handling bees.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>C. H. Dibbern is not satisfied with
his bee escape invented the latter
part of last season, and claims now
that he has another almost perfected
which will beat anything yet.
A great man on bee escapes is our
friend Dibbern. By the way, M. E.
Hastings has recently invented an escape
something on the principle of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
the Porter, which appears to be about
perfect. We will endeavor to give
an illustration and description of it
next month.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Edward R. Newcomb, formerly of
Pleasant Valley, N. Y., has moved to
Chicago and has given up his supply
business; also the manufacture of
the Stanley Automatic Extractor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Everyone whose subscription has
expired, or is about to expire, will do
well to take advantage of our seed
offer given in another column; a $1.50
box of seeds, &amp;c., for only 25 cents.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ever-increasing migration to
the Tropics from American ports will
probably receive a fresh stimulus
from the article on the Highlands of
Jamaica, which Lady Blake, the wife
of the Governor of Jamaica, contributes
to the March number of the
<i>North American Review</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>“THE FLOWERS OF CHILI.”</h3>

<p>This week’s issue of <i>Frank Leslie’s
Illustrated Newspaper</i> being the colored
number, contains a beautiful
page of portraits of the handsome
women of Chili, a sleighing scene in
Chicago, character sketches from the
tenth annual dinner of the famous
Clover Club of Philadelphia, illustration
of the Young Women’s Christian
Association and Margaret Louisa
Home of New York City, and of the
“Captain Prat,” the formidable Chilian
ironclad. The Children’s Department
contains a beautiful story entitled
“Majorie’s Valentine,” and the Graphological
Department is full of interest,
while the fashion letter and editorial
pages, together with the beautiful
colored front page, make this
number the handsomest that the
Arkell Weekly Company has ever
published. Price only 10 cents; 12
numbers $1.00, with flower premiums
catalogued at $1.25 by Messrs. Peter
Henderson &amp; Co., $1.25.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The complete novel in <i>Lippincott’s
Magazine</i> for March, “A Soldier’s Secret,”
is by Captain Charles King,
who alone among living Americans
has the secret of the military tale.
What he does not know about army
life in the West is not worth knowing,
and what he knows he can impart
with unsurpassed and unfailing
charm. The post, the bivouac, the
battlefield,&mdash;whatever goes on at
these he makes to live again before
us; for he has been a part of it all,
and his heart is with the cavalry still.
His last story has a very recent theme;
the Sioux war of 1890,&mdash;and will be
found equal to any of his previous
work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>IMPORTANT TRADE NOTICES.</h3>

<p>We are in want of bees wax and
will pay 25 to 27 cents per pound
cash, or 28 to 30 cents in trade for
good to choice pure bees wax delivered
at Falconer, N. Y. If you have
any, box it up and ship it to us by
freight or express, (which ever is
cheapest). Be sure and send it to us
at Falconer, N. Y., and write your
name also on the package so we will
know from whom it comes, also write
us at the time you ship.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Colored and Cull Sections</span> very
cheap. We have several thousand
4¼ × 4¼ × 1⅞ and 1 15-16 sections which
are not first class, some being very
poor and others good; altogether they
are a fair lot and very cheap at $1.50
per thousand, which is the price at
which we will sell them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Alsike Clover Seed</span> is considerably
higher price now than quoted on
page 27 of our catalogue. We can
now supply a limited quantity at 25
cents per pound, $3.00 per peck or
$11.00 per bu. Postage 9 cents per
lb. if by mail. Price subject to change
without notice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We wish to call attention to the
fact that we can furnish the <i>Hastings
Feeders</i> to anyone wanting them.
They are first class, and in some ways
much better than any other in use.
The price is 30 cents each; $3.00 per
dozen. Postage 13 cents each extra.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
